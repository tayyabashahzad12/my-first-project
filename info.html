        <li>The Neanderthals have a long evolutionary history.</li>
        <li>The earliest known examples of Neanderthal-like fossils are around 430,000 years old.</li>
        <li>The best-known Neanderthals lived between about 130,000 and 40,000 years ago,
            after which all physical evidence of them vanishes.</li>
        <li>Neanderthals are an extinct species of hominids that were the closest relatives to modern human beings.</li>
        <li> They lived throughout Europe and parts of Asia from about 400,000 until about 40,000 years ago,
            and they were adept at hunting large Ice Age animals. </li>
